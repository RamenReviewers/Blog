# Adding a Review

To add a review do the following:
- Add a new directory at 'src/main/resources'
- Copy the template review called 'review.yaml' from 'src/main/resources/templates' into your new directory
- Change the values of the copied template. Please don't change any key names and only change values.
- If you want to add links, please make sure to append the list with two key-value-pairs like the template shows.
- Images inside the review directory will be added automatically, please don't make a sub-directory for the images.
